A Lithuanian Flashcard deck, for [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), based on Fluent-Forever's 625 basic vocabulary items. Get the latest release [HERE](https://github.com/dainius-sileika/Lithuanian_Flashcards/releases).

The goal of this project is to create a vocabulary deck with good pictures on the front side, and audio and text on the back. For nouns, where relevent, there should be the masculine and feminine forms, as well as the nominative and genitive cases; for verbs, the infintive, third person singular, and past tense should be included.  

Presently, the deck features good images and audio from HyperTTS; evertually, the project aims to have excellent, sourced, images, and audio of native speakers saying the target words.
